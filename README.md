This project concerns the Boston House Prices dataset, qhich was first published in 1978 contains US census data concerning houses in various areas around the city of Boston. The project consists in descriptive and inferential statistics, and prediction of the variable price using keras to create a neural network.

This project requires [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/) and the following Python libraries installed:

+ [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
+ [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
+ [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
+ [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
+ [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
+ [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
+ [statsmodel](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
+ [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
+ [keras](https://keras.io/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9fntBRCGARIsAGjFq5EFA7NNOa86XsKJg4I2mIvpQxMc7VX9xrF-VxVv1qKTX--luqVx-R8aAoJsEALw_wcB) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Template code is provided in the `Boston_House_Dataset.ipynb` notebook file.
